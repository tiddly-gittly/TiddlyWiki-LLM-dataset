`wikitext
title: $:/config/ui/EditTemplate

This line defines the title of the tiddler. In TiddlyWiki, a tiddler is a basic unit of information, and its title is a unique identifier. Here, the title is set to $:/config/ui/EditTemplate, which suggests that this tiddler is related to the configuration of the user interface (UI) for an "EditTemplate."

wikitext
text: $:/core/ui/EditTemplate

This line specifies the text content of the tiddler. The text is set to $:/core/ui/EditTemplate, which likely refers to another tiddler in the TiddlyWiki core that contains the actual template or configuration for the UI element. This is a common pattern in TiddlyWiki where one tiddler references another to inherit or use its content.
