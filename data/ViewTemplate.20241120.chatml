`wikitext
title: $:/config/ui/ViewTemplate

This line specifies the title of the tiddler. In TiddlyWiki, a tiddler is a basic unit of information, and its title is a unique identifier. Here, the title is set to $:/config/ui/ViewTemplate, which suggests that this tiddler is a configuration related to the user interface (UI) and specifically to the "ViewTemplate."

wikitext
text: $:/core/ui/ViewTemplate

This line sets the text content of the tiddler. The text is a reference to another tiddler, $:/core/ui/ViewTemplate. This indicates that the current tiddler is essentially a pointer or a reference to the core UI ViewTemplate tiddler. In TiddlyWiki, this is a common way to reuse or inherit content from another tiddler.
