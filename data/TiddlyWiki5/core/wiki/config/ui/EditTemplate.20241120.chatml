The title is prefixed with $:/, which indicates that this tiddler is part of the core configuration or system settings of the TiddlyWiki.

wikitext
text: $:/core/ui/EditTemplate

This line sets the text content of the tiddler. The text is a reference to another tiddler, specifically $:/core/ui/EditTemplate. This means that the content of this tiddler is sourced from the tiddler with the title $:/core/ui/EditTemplate. Essentially, this tiddler is acting as a pointer or alias to the core UI edit template, allowing it to be used or referenced elsewhere in the wiki.
